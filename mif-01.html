    <h2>Mission Impossible</h2>
    <br>
    

    <p> Mission: Impossible is a series of American action spy films, based on the 1966 TV series created by
        Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by Tom Cruise, who plays Ethan Hunt, an agent of the 
        Impossible Mission Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and scored by various filmmakers 
        and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original series by Lalo Schifrin.

        Starting in 1996, it follows the missions of the IMF's main field team, under Hunt's leadership, to stop
        an enemy force and prevent an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt's character, and
        like the television series' structure, is complemented by an ensemble cast, such as Luther Stickell 
        (played by Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg), who have recurring roles.
